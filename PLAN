Two queues:

* A scheduled queue
	Filled once every [configurable] period
	Runs a set of commands based on the device type
		Such as "show version" etc
	The output is put into a file per command: group/device/command

* A triggered queue
	A syslog listener is made
	If it receives a particular string from a device, it adds to this queue
	It logs into that device and gets the current config
	It then commits that config under the user found in the string
		The user can be mapped to a user-email pair based on config

Parallel running:

Each queue feeds into a worker queue - triggered updates are higher priority
	Example here: http://docs.python.org/2/library/queue.html

Adding new devices:

User creates new user/pass (and is told why!)
User runs "autoexpect", turns off autopaging and runs a couple of commands
User removes new user/pass
User submits expect file to bug tracker
Developer converts it into useful expect code

Day One platforms:

Cisco IOS
Cisco IOS XR
Cisco ASA
Brocade NetIron
Brocade BigIron
Brocade FastIron
JUNOS

Consider also specifying model number to use more commands specific to that model
