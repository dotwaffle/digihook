This is for triggered updates.

Configurable:
	Listens for TCP/UDP syslog entries
	Listens for TCP/UDP snmp traps
	Polls (if available) for "last updated config" snmp value
	Watches a file

Passes through a filter to detect what has updated (whether it's noise or an actual update)

Add an entry to the schedule if needed

Blocks early, blocks often.
